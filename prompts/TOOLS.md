# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define how tools work. This file records what is specific to your environment.

## What Goes Here

Examples:

- Camera names and locations.
- SSH hosts and aliases.
- Preferred TTS voices.
- Speaker or room names.
- Device nicknames.
- Any environment-specific details that improve execution.

## Example

```markdown
### Cameras
- living-room -> Main area, 180-degree wide angle
- front-door -> Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH
- home-server -> 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS
- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Separate This

Skills are shareable. Your setup is private and variable. Keeping them separate prevents:

- Losing local notes when skills are updated.
- Leaking infrastructure details when sharing skills.

Keep this as your practical cheat sheet.
